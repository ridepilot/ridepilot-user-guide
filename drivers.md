## **Drivers**

Data on drivers is something you will enter initially and then update as needed. The system will provide information on paid and volunteer staff, tracking items such as availability, licensing, and training. For setting up your system, you will enter information about each of your drivers. On an ongoing basis you will update information as it changes.

Note the navigation tabs on the upper right side. These are used to upload documents, and to delete, edit or inactivate driver records.
