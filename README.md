# RidePilot User Guide

RidePilot is a scheduling and dispatch system for demand-response transportation providers.  It will make everyday tasks easier, and integrates information about clients, schedules, vehicles, and drivers in a single program.

RidePilot is designed for small demand-responsive transportation providers operating up to five or even ten vehicles.

* Two key differences between RidePilot and the scheduling software programs available for sale are: RidePilot uses manual scheduling. While the information on clients that is used to schedule a trip is stored in a client database and can be scheduled on a vehicle with the click of a mouse, the scheduler makes the decision about which vehicle on which to place the trip. There is not a scheduling algorithm that calculates the optimum vehicle on which to schedule the trip. For this reason the program is bet suited to relatively small systems.

* RidePilot is an open source software system. This means that it is freely available to the public; there is no need to purchase the program. An agency will still need to provide for setup, on-going upkeep, and hosting. It is a web-based system.

This document is written for agencies where RidePilot is set up on your computer system. It will guide you through the process of setting up new customers, drivers, or vehicles on RidePilot in your system and provides basic instructions on how to use the system. It can be used as a reference document for training new employees or reminding you how to complete tasks that are only required occasionally.

This User Guide is part of the standard documentation for the program. It complements the technical documentation that describes how to download the program files, arrange for hosting, and get the basic system set up in your office.
