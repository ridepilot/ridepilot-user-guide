# Customers

### **Customers**

Before you can schedule trips, you will need to enter key data including information on customers. In this section we will describe how to enter data for each customer. For setting up your system, you will enter information about each of your customers. On an ongoing basis you will add customers as they register with you and delete customers you no longer serve.

The navigation bar on the upper right side of the page is what you will use to move around the page, adding, editing, or inactivating customer records.

The page contains basic customer information in the left column. To enter information, place your cursor over the text box and type in the data. Some text boxes have drop down menus, so for those you select the menu and make a choice for the rider. There is a place to add a picture as a visual identifier. Drag and drop the picture \(in a \_\_\_\_ file\) to add it to the file.

The right side of the page contains a variety of more detailed information about each customer. These are reviewed individually. The text boxes are shown in summary on the main sheet. When you click on the text box it expands to make it easy to see the options available in dropdown menus and to add and delete entries.
